# truths

A simple command line interface in Haskell for examining formulas in propositional logic by generating and cross-checking truth tables.

# Sample session

It's easiest to just show the functionality with a picture:

# Download

I hope to generate some binaries some time soon.

# Code Notes

The parser, expression evaluation and half of the truth table logic is very nice code.
The cli and equality code on the other hand is best left unseen; I hope to clean it up eventually.

Anyhow, there are only around 200 lines of code, so it should be quite easy to understand how it works.
